# Road quality map of China

A visual representation of road qualities on G, S or smaller roads, as a support tool for monitoring and planning trips through out china. The data is collected and represented from a motorcycle perspective. Cars should use the highway, so we bikers can ride safer and have more fun!     

There is support for Google maps and a mapbox version. 

Data is in geoJSON format and currently aimed at the google maps solution, meaning there will be a small offset on the mapbox version. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China)

Feel free to propose pull requests with additional geoJSON data (through out China)
